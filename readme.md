1. Dataset prepration 
    * BUPT balanced dataset can be downloaded following the intructions in this website [link](http://www.whdeng.cn/RFW/Trainingdataste.html)
    * BIDMC PPG dataset can be downloaded in [link](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/bidmc_dataset.html)

2. Code dependency 
    * The generation of synthetic videos is based on the code of [DECA](https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/SIGGRAPH21_DECA.pdf). The [code](https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA) of DECA needs to be in put in the same folder as the `rppg_generation.ipynb`.

3. The rPPG generation code is in `rppg_generation.ipynb` and the training of rPPG networks are in `prn_training.ipynb`.

4. The pretrained weights for Biofacenet and some samples of real data can be found in the anonymous link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WJGFVUfi7HvoFAuUV4J_VwxW2GwU_SUw?usp=sharing.
